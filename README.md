## Why this exists

This project was built to learn the Sinatra framework, and get better aquainted with both Active Record & a M.V.C. style of building an application. This was build on the back of the Corneal gem, which you can find here (https://thebrianemory.github.io/corneal/). I've even heard rumors of an updated one built by the new Flatiron staff. 

## How this exists

  1. run bundle/bundle install
  2. migrate the database, and seed it with the corporations list.
  3. crack open the terminal and load two shells in ("shotgun")
  4. profit (open the link in your browser).
